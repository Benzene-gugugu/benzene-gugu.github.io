# Publications

## Conferences
[1] Zhao, Ziang. “Research on the evolution of neural networks models in NLP.” (2023).
- Description: This paper briefly outlined the evolution of neural network model utilizations within the field of NLP and tried to outline an overall reasoning behind the utilization of different models within the field. The paper has also outlined future possible renovations within the field as possible places for further research areas. 


# Academic and Independent Projects

## CPU Design with custom ISA (ECE 552 Final Project)
-	Used Verilog to implement a CPU and a memory bus system with independent L1 caches
-	Implements a five-stage in-order pipelining
-	Could execute simple programs and handle hits and misses of caches normally
